# Companion Guide Template

> **Purpose:** This template is for creating session-specific companion guides — step-by-step reference documents that students can follow alongside the instructor's live demo. Particularly useful for students who need additional support with file navigation and interface location.

## How to Use This Template

For each session where you do a live demo, create a companion guide that:

1. **Mirrors your exact demo steps** — every click you make, the guide shows
2. **Includes screenshots** — so students can visually match their screen to yours
3. **Uses the See It, Name It, Find It, Do It pattern** for every interaction
4. **Provides "If you get lost" recovery points** — at each major step, tell students how to get back on track

## Companion Guide Structure
